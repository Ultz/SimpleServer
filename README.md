# SimpleServer
SimpleServer is an in-development server environment, written in C#, that natively supports Windows, Mac and the main flavours of Linux.

Our core values for SimpleServer are:
- **Be expandable**: We want developers to develop third-party programs to use the SimpleServer environment, making it easy for developers to make high speed web programs.
- **Be efficient**: We want SimpleServer to be able to handle lots of simultanious requests without losing speed or consuming lots of system resources, making it a powerful and cheap server environment for businesses.
- **Everyone should be able to make a server**: We believe that everyone should be able to make a server, which is why we are bundling SimpleServer with some easy-to-use tools for making a server.
